# Kunal's Portfolio

Hello There!,Thank you for visiting my profile! Hope you'll find some interesting stuff here!
I've created Repositories containing portfolio of data science/ machine Learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.


## Contents

## Machine Learning:
1.  [Predicting Boston Housing Prices:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Boston%20Housing)
     A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
2.  [Supervised Learning:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/finding_donors)
     Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
3.  [Unsupervised Learning:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/customer_segments)
     Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

##   Data Analysis and Visualisation
A.  Python:
1.  [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)
     Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
2. [Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb)
     Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
3.  [2016 US General Election Poll Data Analysis:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/2016%20General%20Election%20Poll%20Analysis.ipynb)
     Very simple analysis of 2016 US General Election Poll data.
4.  [911 Calls - Exploratory Analysis:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb) 
    Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
--Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Micro Projects:

A.  Python:

1.  [ML with Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
     Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
2.  [ML with K Nearest Neighbours:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/ML%20Micro%20Projects/ML%20with%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)
     Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
3.  [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb)
    Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
4.  [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems:](https://github.com/kunalsaga/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb)
    A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
